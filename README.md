# Artificial Intelligence : Conga Game
Term Project : Game Playing through Adversarial Search
I mplement an AI agent using a high-level programming language: the AI agent will employ adversarial search with alpha-beta pruning and heuristics-based evaluation function to play a two-person board game, Conga. Here is the official Conga board game webpage: http://www.congaspiel.de/

* Game definition, rules and assumptions are given in the EECS 4740 Term Project.pdf. The project report has some understanding of the code and approach.

* Just want to play the game without touching code ? -  download the .exe file and run it using different combination of depth and evaluation functions. 

* Executable  has been created from the given AI_Conga.cpp file.
